# Premier League Match Outcome Prediction using Random Forest

This repository contains the source code and data for a machine learning model designed to predict the outcomes of English Premier League matches. The project leverages a Random Forest Classifier and demonstrates a complete workflow from data ingestion to model evaluation and tuning.

-----

## üìã Description

This project implements a predictive model using historical match data from the **2021/22** and **2022/23** Premier League seasons. The primary objective is to showcase the practical application of the Random Forest algorithm and core data science libraries for a sports analytics use case. The model processes historical data to classify match outcomes.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Data Preprocessing**: Demonstrates techniques for cleaning and preparing raw sports data for modeling.
  * **Model Implementation**: Provides a clear implementation of the `RandomForestClassifier` from the Scikit-learn library.
  * **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Showcases methods for optimizing model performance through systematic tuning.
  * **Performance Evaluation**: Utilizes standard metrics to evaluate and compare the performance of the baseline and optimized models.

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries Used

  * **Programming Language**: `Python 3.x`
  * **Development Environment**: `Google Colaboratory`
  * **Core Libraries**:
      * `Pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
      * `Scikit-learn (sklearn)`: For implementing the machine learning model and evaluation metrics.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage

To replicate the project and run the model, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhaygithub7/Match_Prediction-PL-.git
    cd Match_Prediction-PL-
    ```

2.  **Download the Dataset**
    Ensure the `matches.csv` data file is present in the root directory of the project.

3.  **Execute the Code**

      * Upload the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) and the CSV file to your Google Drive.
      * Open the notebook in Google Colaboratory.
      * Execute the code cells sequentially to perform data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## ü§ñ Model & Methodology

The predictive model is built using a **Random Forest** algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time.

The project workflow is as follows:

1.  **Data Ingestion**: Loading the historical match data from the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and converting data types for compatibility with the model.
3.  **Feature Engineering & Selection**: Identifying and selecting the most relevant features (e.g., team form, match statistics) to serve as predictors.
4.  **Model Training**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and training an initial `RandomForestClassifier`.
5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model's parameters (such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`) to enhance predictive accuracy and prevent overfitting.
6.  **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on the unseen test data using the accuracy score metric.

## üìä Results

The model's performance was evaluated based on its predictive accuracy. The optimization process yielded a substantial improvement in performance.

  * **Baseline Model Accuracy**: **61%**
  * **Tuned Model Accuracy**: **84%**

This significant increase of **23%** highlights the critical importance of model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning in the machine learning lifecycle.
